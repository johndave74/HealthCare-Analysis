# Healthcare Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data using SQL. It covers patient demographics, age distribution, gender statistics, and city-wise patient trends. The dataset is structured to provide insights into healthcare services utilization.

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights
### 1️⃣ Patient Demographics
- Extracted **age distribution** by categorizing patients into different age brackets.
- Analyzed **gender distribution** to understand male-to-female patient ratio.
- Evaluated **city-wise patient count** to identify regions with the highest healthcare demands.

### 2️⃣ Healthcare Services Utilization
- Identified the **most common health conditions** among patients.
- Mapped **hospital visits per city** to highlight high-demand locations.
- Examined **treatment trends** across various demographics.

### 3️⃣ Database Structure & Queries
- Created a **relational database** to manage patient records.
- Used **JOIN operations** to link patients with hospital visits and treatment records.
- Applied **aggregate functions** to summarize healthcare statistics effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** for database creation, data extraction, and analysis.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for structuring complex queries.
- **Data Aggregation** using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` functions.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
